    # Parkinson's Disease Prediction Web App

This project is a web application built with Flask that predicts the likelihood of Parkinson's Disease based on voice measurement features. Users input specific medical data, and the app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to provide a diagnosis.

The app also stores each prediction along with the input data in a MongoDB database for future reference and analysis.

## Key Features

- Predicts Parkinson's Disease using voice metrics.
- User-friendly web interface for input and results.
- Stores prediction records in MongoDB.
- Color-coded output messages to indicate diagnosis.

---

## Technologies

- Python (Flask framework)
- Machine Learning (pre-trained model with pickle)
- MongoDB for data storage
- HTML and CSS for frontend

---

## Purpose

The main goal is to provide an easy-to-use tool for early detection of Parkinson's Disease through voice analysis, combined with data persistence for tracking and analysis.
